## Creational Design Patterns.

Creational desing patterns provide various objeects creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclases to alter the type of objects that Will be creates.
- **Abstract Factory**: Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allow you to produce different types and representations o fan object usig the same construction code.
- **Prototype**: Lets you copy existing objects without making your code depende ton their classes.
- **Singleton**: Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while prooviding a global Access point to This instance.
